Package generator provides the code generation library for go-swagger.

# Generating data types

The general idea is that you should rarely see any in the generated code.
You get a complete representation of a swagger document in somewhat idiomatic go.

To do so, there is a set of mapping patterns that are applied,
to map a Swagger specification to go types:

	   definition of primitive   => type alias/name
	   definition of array       => type alias/name
	   definition of map         => type alias/name

	   definition of object
	   with properties           => struct
	   definition of $ref        => type alias/name

	   object with only
	   additional properties     => map[string]T

	   object with additional
	   properties and properties => custom serializer

	   schema with schema array
	   in items                  => tuple (struct with properties, custom serializer)

	   schema with all of        => struct

	     * allOf schema with $ref        => embedded value
	     * allOf schema with properties  => properties are included in struct
	     * adding an allOf schema with just "x-isnullable": true or
		   "x-nullable": true turns the schema into a pointer when
		   there are only other extension properties provided

NOTE: anyOf and oneOf JSON-schema constructs are not supported by Swagger 2.0

A property on a definition is a pointer when any one of the following conditions is met:

	    it is an object schema (struct)
	    it has x-nullable or x-isnullable as vendor extension
	    it is a primitive where the zero value is valid but would fail validation
		otherwise strings minLength > 0 or required results in non-pointer
	    numbers min > 0, max < 0 and min < max

JSONSchema and by extension Swagger allow for items that have a fixed size array,
with the schema describing the items at each index. This can be combined with additional items
to form some kind of tuple with varargs.

To map this to go it creates a struct that has fixed names and a custom json serializer.

NOTE: the additionalItems keyword is not supported by Swagger 2.0. However, the generator and validator parts
in go-swagger do.

# Documenting the generated code

The code that is generated also gets the doc comments that are used by the scanner
to generate a spec from go code. So that after generation you should be able to reverse
generate a spec from the code that was generated by your spec.

It should be equivalent to the original spec but might miss some default values and examples.
