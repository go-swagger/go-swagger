<!-- Questions about install, setup and dependencies -->

## Installation and environment

### What is the minimal go version required?
Our policy is to support the two latest versions of the go compiler.

That being said, as of Dec. 2017, our CI engines currently run all tests on go 1.7, on Linux and Windows platforms.

You should be able to build with go **1.6**, but we won't proceed to changes in order to maintain backward compatibility with 1.6.
