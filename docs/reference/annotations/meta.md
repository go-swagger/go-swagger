# swagger:meta

The **swagger:meta** annotation flags a file as source for metadata about the API.
This is typically a doc.go file with your package documentation.

You can specify a Consumes and Produces key which has a new content type on each line
Schemes is a tag that is required and allows for a comma separated string composed of:
http, https, ws or wss

Host and BasePath can be specified but those values will be defaults,
they should get substituted when serving the swagger spec.

The description property uses the rest of the comment block as description for the api when not explicitly provided
