  # Project stance regarding linting - see also https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/3237:
  #
  # * we enable all linters by default
  # * we disable explicitly linters which:
  #   * do not correspond to our own views of go best practices (e.g. recvcheck, nonamedreturns)
  #   * impose a lot of (cosmetic) changes for no real value AND do not provide an auto-fix (e.g. godox, nlreturn)
  #   * impose a lot of not-cosmetic changes with no high value AND do not provide an auto-fix (e.g. err113)
  #   * introduce breaking changes (normally, we should disable them sparingly with code hints, no globally)
  #   * we overall agree with but are temporarily disabled: these issues would be addressed progressively
  #
  # This project has been living around for about 10 years now.
  # It adopted golangci-lint as one of its early adopters.
  # Since then, we've seen a lot of back and forth on how we should write good go code.
  # So we pick every month's new doxa with a pinch of salt.
