// Package restapi Composing authorizations
//
//  This sample API demonstrates how to compose several authentication schemes
//  and configure complex security requirements for your operations.
//
//  This API simulates a very simple market place with customers and resellers
//  of items.
//
//  Personas:
//    - as a first time user, I want to see all items on sales
//    - as a registered customer, I want to post orders for items and
//      consult my past orders
//    - as a registered reseller, I want to see all pending orders on the items
//      I am selling on the market place
//    - as a reseller managing my own inventories, I want to post replenishment orders for the items I provide
//    - as a register user, I want to consult my personal account infos
//
//  The situation we defined on the authentication side is as follows:
//    - every known user is authenticated using a basic token
//    - resellers are authenticated using API keys - we let the option to authenticate using a header or query param
//    - any registered user (customer or reseller) will add a signed JWT to access more API endpoints
//
//  Obviously, there are several ways to achieve the same result. We just wanted to demonstrate here how
//  security requirements may compose several schemes.
//
//  Note that we used the "OAuth2" declaration here but don't implement a real
//  OAuth2 workflow: our intend here is just to be able to extract scopes from a passed JWT token (the
//  only way to manipulate scoped authorizers with Swagger 2.0 is to declare them with type "oauth2").
